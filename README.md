# D-Memory-Game

This project is a simple web-based game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to match pairs of emojis within a set time limit. Players must identify a specific emoji in one box and find its matching counterpart in another box.

Features:

Game Board: The game board consists of multiple boxes, each containing an emoji. These emojis are randomly assigned and duplicated in pairs.

Timer: A countdown timer is displayed to add a sense of urgency. Players must complete the game within the allocated time.

Scoring: Keep track of the player's score, possibly by counting the number of successful matches.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the game is responsive and playable across different devices and screen sizes.
